# Unsupervised Clustering Machine Learning (ML) 
## How extensive are you coorking or smoking indoors (ML/AI can help you find out!)

Combustion activities such as cooking or smoking significantly contribute to indoor particulate matter (PM) emissions. Given that we spend a substantial portion of our lives indoors (> 85%), primarily at homes, understanding and identifying combustion-driven PM sources is crucial. By determining the duration and intensity of these activities, we can mitigate exposure to airborne PM, which poses significant long-term health risks including lung cancer, heart disease, asthma exacerbation, and premature death.

## This Repository
In this repository, I developed an unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithm by means of clustering to to detect and characterize combustion-driven source regimes for PM2.5. The algorithm calculates the duration and emission rate of PM2.5 within these regimes. This approach is feasible due to the unique temporal patterns exhibited by PM2.5 concentrations during source emission regimes when compared to other courses. The absence of labeled data on PM2.5 sources necessitated an unsupervised learning framework. This research is part of Mahdavi et al. (2021) Environmental Pollution where PM concentrations were measured using optical sensors in a single-family home for a duration of close to 6 weeks.
